- Zephyr

## Technical Architecture üèóÔ∏è

OllamaChat Arena combines three powerful technologies:
- **OpenAI Swarm**: Handles agent communication and conversation flow
- **Ollama**: Provides local inference capabilities for various open-source language models
- **Streamlit**: Creates the beautiful UI and handles real-time updates

## Troubleshooting üîç

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Model Loading Errors**:
   - Ensure Ollama is running (`ollama serve`)
   - Check available models (`ollama list`)
   - Verify model is downloaded (`ollama pull model_name`)

2. **Conversation Stalls**:
   - Check Ollama service status
   - Monitor system resources
   - Try restarting the application

3. **Model Switching Issues**:
   - Clear chat history before switching models
   - Ensure both models are fully downloaded
   - Check model compatibility
